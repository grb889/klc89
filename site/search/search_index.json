These tools are the gateway to creating burner accounts and sock puppets, because they allow a persona to be born without requiring any element of your real digital footprint.</p> <p>In this section, we will examine disposable email services, temporary SMS and VoIP applications, and regional alternatives that expand beyond U.S.-centric solutions. By the end of this part, you will understand not only which tools are available but also their strengths, limitations, and the specific investigative scenarios in which each is most useful.</p>"},{"location":"Burner_Accounts/#1-disposable-email-services","title":"1. Disposable Email Services","text":"<p>The most accessible entry point into the world of temporary communication is the disposable email address. Many websites, applications, and communities require an email for registration or verification. Using your personal inbox would immediately compromise anonymity. Instead, you can rely on temporary providers.</p> <p>Temp Mail is perhaps the best-known disposable inbox service. The process is simple: you visit the Temp Mail website or download the app, and a randomly generated email address is assigned to you. Incoming messages appear directly in the browser interface. Once the investigation is complete or after a short expiry period, the inbox vanishes, taking with it any traceable connection to you.</p> <p>For OSINT analysts, Temp Mail can be used in several ways. It allows rapid testing of signup processes \u2014 for example, determining whether a platform uses simple email verification, link-based confirmation, or more advanced anti-automation measures. It also offers opportunities to analyze email headers and metadata, which reveal the infrastructure behind a service\u2019s mail servers. And, of course, it enables the creation of burner accounts on platforms where long-term persistence is not required.</p> <p>But this simplicity comes with limitations. Because Temp Mail inboxes are public and ephemeral, anyone who guesses the address could read your messages. Additionally, many major platforms have blacklisted Temp Mail\u2019s domains, making it ineffective for services that actively filter disposable emails. Finally, the short lifespan of the inbox makes it unsuitable for investigations that span weeks or months.</p> <p>For more control, Maildrop offers another free disposable service. Unlike Temp Mail, it allows you to create a custom address on the <code>maildrop.cc</code> domain without registration. This gives you more flexibility in choosing a handle while still keeping the account disposable. Yet Maildrop, too, is intended for one-time use, not for maintaining a sustained sock puppet identity.</p> <p>A more advanced alternative is StartMail, a privacy-focused paid provider. StartMail allows unlimited disposable aliases that link back to your main secure inbox. Each alias can be created for a particular registration, target, or campaign, and discarded if it becomes compromised. Unlike free throwaway services, StartMail maintains reliability and security, making it appropriate for longer investigative cycles.</p>"},{"location":"Burner_Accounts/#2-temporary-sms-and-voip-services","title":"2. Temporary SMS and VoIP Services","text":"<p>While email is often enough to get started, many platforms now enforce phone verification as an additional barrier against automation and fraud. To bypass this without exposing your personal number, temporary SMS and VoIP services become essential.</p> <p>TextFree provides free U.S.-based numbers that operate through an app on Android or iOS. After registering with a basic email and password, you select a number and can immediately send and receive SMS or calls over the internet. This makes TextFree a convenient way to pass phone number checks or to test how a platform treats VoIP versus mobile network numbers.</p> <p>Similarly, TextNow offers free numbers from the U.S. and Canada, with a reputation for slightly better reliability. In addition to SMS and calls, TextNow supports voicemail and, in some cases, call recording (where legal), giving it additional investigative utility. TextNow numbers also tend to remain active for longer than TextFree\u2019s, making them more appropriate for sock puppets that must survive for weeks rather than days.</p> <p>These services, however, share significant limitations. They are restricted to North America, meaning they are poorly suited to investigations that require European or Asian number formats. Their numbers are also VoIP-based, which many platforms reject outright.

They allow you to receive SMS verifications instantly, making them useful for quick, one-time signups. The trade-off is that they are public \u2014 anyone monitoring the same number can read the verification message \u2014 and there is no persistence for long-term personas.</p> <p>More advanced options include PingMe, which provides numbers in multiple regions, and Sonetel, a paid service offering European VoIP numbers with higher reliability and features like call forwarding. MoreMins expands coverage further, with numbers from over 50 countries, including Lithuania and Ukraine, and offers free incoming SMS with low-cost outgoing communication. Fanytel adds UK numbers to the mix, while GoGetSMS covers over 80 countries on a pay-per-SMS basis, which is cost-effective when only a single verification is required.</p> <p>A particularly useful service is MobileSMS.io, which offers non-VoIP numbers from several countries, including the UK and Germany. Because they are not flagged as VoIP, these numbers are more likely to be accepted by platforms with strict anti-fraud filters.

A burner account that exists only for a single login session may serve a one-off purpose, but OSINT investigations often require repeated engagements, infiltration of groups, or long-term monitoring of target activity. For these more complex tasks, we move beyond isolated tools to the deliberate construction of sock puppet accounts: digital personas that are controlled by the investigator, yet appear independent, believable, and resilient.</p> <p>Sock puppets are not merely \u201cfake accounts.\u201d When crafted with professional discipline, they are compartmentalized identities \u2014 each with its own communication channels, browsing environment, behavioral patterns, and sometimes even financial instruments. The objective is not only to maintain anonymity but to ensure that a compromise in one channel (for example, the recycling of a temporary phone number) does not cascade across the entire persona. This principle is known as compartmentation, and it is the backbone of effective OSINT tradecraft.</p>"},{"location":"Burner_Accounts/#1-the-principle-of-compartmentation","title":"1. The Principle of Compartmentation","text":"<p>Compartmentation means that no single element of a sock puppet should overlap with another identity. The email used for registration should not be linked to the same phone number as another persona; the browser or device fingerprint should be isolated; even payment methods, if required, should be separated. In practice, this reduces cross-attribution risks. If a temporary SMS number fails, only that specific puppet is affected, not your entire suite of investigative personas.</p> <p>Beyond simple anonymity, compartmentation ensures sustainability. A sock puppet is not just a placeholder; it can be created, maintained, rotated, and eventually retired like any other operational resource. Analysts should keep records of each persona\u2019s credentials, history, and purpose. This allows for audits, prevents duplication, and ensures compliance with legal and ethical boundaries.</p>"},{"location":"Burner_Accounts/#2-multi-channel-identity-suites","title":"2. Multi-Channel Identity Suites","text":"<p>Among the most efficient tools for sock puppet construction are multi-channel identity suites: applications that integrate phone, messaging, email, and sometimes even payment instruments into a single, compartmentalized package.</p> <p>MySudo is a leading example. Within a single app, users can create multiple identities called \u201cSudos.\u201d Each Sudo comes equipped with its own phone number (currently limited to U.S., U.K., and Canadian coverage), SMS/MMS capability, voice calling, encrypted chat between Sudos, and a distinct <code>@sudomail.com</code> email address. Some versions even include the option for virtual payment cards (though this feature may require identity verification and is limited to U.S. users). A companion VPN service further strengthens anonymity.</p> <p>For OSINT, MySudo provides a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for burner account creation. An investigator can assign a Sudo to a particular target or campaign, ensuring all related communications, registrations, and browsing stay within that single compartment. When the investigation concludes, the Sudo can be retired without touching any other identities. While the limitation to Anglo-American phone numbers reduces its effectiveness for some European operations, pairing MySudo with regional virtual number providers can overcome this gap.</p>"},{"location":"Burner_Accounts/#3-data-only-messaging-platforms","title":"3. Data-Only Messaging Platforms","text":"<p>Sometimes, a sock puppet does not require a phone number at all. When the purpose is secure communication rather than registration, data-only messaging apps provide anonymity without the attribution risks of telephony.</p> <p>Two prominent examples are Threema (Switzerland) and Olvid (France). Both prioritize privacy and metadata minimization. Unlike mainstream messengers, they do not require a phone number or email to register. Threema, for instance, assigns each user a random ID, and Olvid uses cryptographic protocols to establish trust without central identifiers.</p> <p>For OSINT teams, these services are valuable for internal coordination, where investigators must communicate without risking exposure of their real numbers. They are also useful for interacting with targets in environments where pseudonymity is expected.

Hushed, by contrast, is more U.S.- and U.K.-focused, but offers strong reliability for those regions. Both allow multiple numbers per account, which can be disposable or maintained long-term depending on investigative needs.</p> <p>These services are ideal for registering social media accounts, email providers, or online services that enforce SMS verification.

With Numero eSIM, an investigator can obtain a number for verification while also connecting to the internet through the same compartment, reducing the need to expose a personal SIM or data plan.</p> <p>For OSINT analysts operating in Europe, Asia, or Africa, Numero eSIM offers flexibility that North American-centric apps lack.

This is due to the foundational design of the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), which did not prioritize security in its early development.</p> <p>An email address in the SMTP protocol has two key components:</p> <ul> <li>The \"Envelope From\" (MAIL FROM): This is the address used by mail servers for delivery and for sending non-delivery reports, also known as \"bounces\".  </li> <li>The \"Header From\" (From): This is the address that appears to the recipient in their email client.</li> </ul> <p>A crucial flaw in the system is that these two addresses do not have to match.

Its format can offer clues about the software used.</li> </ul> <p>Step 5: Verify Sender Authentication</p> <p>Modern email systems use three primary authentication methods to combat spoofing. These are critical for determining an email's legitimacy.</p> <ul> <li>SPF (Sender Policy Framework): A DNS record that specifies which mail servers are authorized to send email for a domain. A  </li> <li>pass result confirms authorization, while fail or softfail indicates an unauthorized server.  </li> <li>DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail): Adds a digital signature to the email header to verify that the content has not been tampered with and that the sender is legitimate. A valid signature indicates authenticity.  </li> <li>DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting &amp; Conformance): A policy that tells a receiving mail server what to do with an email that fails SPF or DKIM check. Look for  </li> <li>Authentication-Results headers for the final verdict.</li> </ul> <p>OSINT Upgrade:</p> <ul> <li>Use mxtoolbox.com or dmarcian.com to query SPF/DKIM/DMARC.  </li> <li>Note: Many phishing domains lack DMARC, or set DMARC to \u201cnone\u201d to avoid rejection.  </li> <li>If DKIM fails \u2192 extract d=domain.com value \u2192 investigate domain age and registrar.</li> </ul> <p>Tutorial Using <code>mxtoolbox.com</code>:</p> <ol> <li>Open your web browser and navigate to <code>mxtoolbox.com</code>.  </li> <li>In the main search bar, enter the domain name you wish to investigate (e.g., <code>google.com</code>).  </li> <li>Click the dropdown menu next to the search bar and select the specific record type you want to query: <code>SPF Record Lookup</code>, <code>DKIM Record Lookup</code>, or <code>DMARC Record Lookup</code>.  </li> <li>Click the search button.
